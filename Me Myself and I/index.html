      <font size="4">I have multiple hobbies. However the ones which I will be discussing within these two paragraphs
        will be my love for playing games and watching tv. When it comes to games I consider myself an expert in first
        person shooters. Due to the fact that I have been playing them for quite a while. When it comes to first person
        shooters I tend to be extremely competitive since I am extremely confident in my skill in games of this
        category. I play Rainbow Six Siege, Black Ops 4, and some CsGo. Along with first person shooters I also enjoy
        playing games that involve strategy such as League of Legends. However when it comes to League I tend to just
        play around with friends. As a result I don’t take it as seriously as a first person shooter as an example
        yesterday I played a game of ap top tristana. It was completely awful but in the end fun. However I don’t just
        play games on my free time. I also enjoy watching tv.

      When it comes to watching tv, I tend to binge watch shows. I use both Hulu and Netflix, and I recently finished
      the office once again. Along with the office I also started watching castle rock and I am finally up to date on
      One Punch Man. When It come to choosing what I am going to watch next I simply look for anything that catches my
      eye. However if I had to choose a prefered genre it would be horror. I simply love Horror, the idea of monsters,
      demons, ghost or any other supernatural being existing intrigues me. I have always been interested in horror and
      eventually it lead to one of my hobbies being my love of watching any movie or tv show that has anything to do
      with horror.
